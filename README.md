# Product Rental Application

This is an in progress project to develop a product rental page. Think of it if Air Bnb and Instagram were to have a child. That child would then be able to post and rent out any products.

##
This app uses React JS and JSON server as a backend framework. 

## Optimizations
* Login and authorization to connect users requests to a admin completion portal.
* Display product requests by date instead of an input text form. 



## Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run React dev server (http://localhost:3000)

```
npm start
```

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)

```
npm run server
```

### To build for production

```
npm run build
```
